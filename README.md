Adopt a Fan proof of concept website
=========
Website available at http://chrisjamesc.github.io/AdoptAFanSWLausanne/

This website has been implemented by the Adopt a Fan team during the startup weekend in Lausanne on February 21-22 2015.

## Technologies used: 
- React.js 
- JSX preprocessor
- Twitter bootstrap
- Original theme: http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/

## Play with code?
Since we are using in-browser JSX compilation, you need to start a local server to view the website.
Launch the following command in the root directory of the website: 

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888

Then, connect to http://localhost:8888
